# Troubleshooting

## Repairing a Connection

If your Todoist connection expires or stops working, repair it as soon as possible to restore functionality:

1. Open the **Homey Mobile App** or **Homey Web App**.
2. Navigate to **Devices** and select your **Todoist User** device.
3. Open the device settings:
   * **Mobile App:** Tap the ⚙️ gear icon → **Repair**
   * **Web App:** Click the ⚙️ gear icon → **Repair**
4. You will be redirected to the Todoist login page to re-authorize access.

## Multiple Todoist Accounts

If you have multiple Todoist accounts, you can add multiple Todoist User devices, one for each account. Each device connects to a separate Todoist account through its own OAuth session.
